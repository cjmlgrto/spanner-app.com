## What is Hugo?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a popular, open-source framework for building static websites. It's essentially a command-line tool that takes a structured folder as input for generating websites.

## What is Spanner?

Spanner wraps Hugo's command line interface in a graphical user interface, allowing you to interact with Hugo's features with just a few clicks.

## How do I use Spanner?

Drag and drop a Hugo site. Then, you can start/stop a local Hugo server, or even build and export your site. If you never used Hugo before, you can download a sample project to use with Spanner.

## Do I need to install Hugo to use Spanner?

Nope. Spanner comes with the latest major version of Hugo. Currently, it's bundled with [version 0.74](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.74.0).

## How do I build a Hugo website?

You can learn to do that via [Hugo's official website](https://gohugo.io/documentation/). It has extensive documentation for templating, managing content, and troubleshooting.

## I still need help!
