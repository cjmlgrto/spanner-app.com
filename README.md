# Spanner for Mac Website

This is the website for Spanner! This folder is set up with the structure of a basic Hugo website.

It has just enough files to quickly get started: a bit of HTML, CSS, and Markdown docs as content for each page of this site. It's a great way to familiarise yourself with Hugo.

## How to Use

1. Drag and drop this folder in Spanner
2. Click Run (or âŒ˜R)
3. Click the link in Spanner to open the site in your browser
4. Edit any of the content, and watch your browser live-refresh with your changes
